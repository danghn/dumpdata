Suppose we have a match:
Football -> England -> Premier League -> Liverpool Arsenal -> 
1x2 -> Whole Match (this is the event part. The event part can be 1st half, 2nd half, whole match etc).

So, you should ask the user the following questions:

1  Chose time range (user chooses 15 March - 15 April)
2  Choose the Sport (user chooses Footbal)
3. Choose the Country  (user chooses England)
4. Choose the League  (user chooses Premier League)
5. Choose the Match (user chooses Liverpool Arsenal)

6. Chose the BettingType (user chooses 1x2)

7. Chose the Parameter (some of the betting types, like asian handicap, over under , have parameters) .

8. Chose the Event Part (user chooses Whole Match)

Note: if it is too difficult we can start with the step 5. Step 5 changes to: 
	Choose the id of the match (user chooses the id of the match).

And then, you should show the report for what the user chose.
